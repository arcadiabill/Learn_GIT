<h1>gettags -- a simple utility for reading tags from MP3, Ogg, and FLAC files</h1>

gettags is a simple, completely self-contained command-line utility for 
reading metadata tags from
audio files. At present, MP3 (ID3v2), Ogg and FLAC files 
(with Vorbis-style comments) are supported. I might add other file types
if I ever accumulate enough file in those formats to make it 
worth the effort.
<p/>
The main purpose of gettags is to make it straightforward to write
shell or perl scripts that move music files around according to their
tags. Although there are plenty of command-line utilities that will 
read the contents of
tags, they typically work only with one type of file. gettags only extracts
a relatively small set of tags, but it does it in the same way across all
file types it supports. 
<p/>
gettags is written entirely in ANSI C, with no dependencies on any other 
libraries. It is open source -- see the 
Download section below -- and can be
compiled for Linux, or for Windows using either Cygwin or MinGW. 
On Windows, the choice of Cygwin or MinGW comes down to whether you want
to run the utility from the Windows command prompt or batch files (MingGW), or
from within a Cygwin session. The MinGW build is a native Windows executable
and does not require Cygwin. However, Unicode support is more predictable
in Cygwin (see below).

<h3>Basic usage</h3>

To display all (text) tags in a file:

<pre>
% gettags {filename}
</pre>
</p>

To display just the title tag, if it is present:

<pre>
% gettags -c title {filename}
</pre>
</p>


To display the specific TALB tag in an MP3 file, if it is present:

<pre>
% gettags -e TALB {filename}
</pre>


<h3>Script mode</h3>

In 'script' mode, which is enabled with the <code>-s</code> switch, all
output from gettags is prefixed with either 'OK' or 'ERROR'. This is intended
to make it easier for scripts to distinguish valid responses from error
responses. However, because all valid output is to <code>stdout</code>, and
error messages are to <code>stderr</code>, it might be easier just to
take the absence of any response on <code>stdout</code> as an indication
of an error. For examle, in perl:


<pre style="background-color: #FFFFD0; padding: 5px">
my $album = `gettags -c album "$file"`;
chomp ($album);
if ($album)
  {
  # There is an album tag, so continue...
  }
else
  {
  die "No album tag in $file\n".
  }

</pre>


<h3>Common names</h3>

The difference between <code>-e</code> and <code>-c</code> is significant.
<code>-e</code> specifies an exact name. The tag will only be displayed if
its exact match is found (case sensitive). However, there is no uniformity
at all between the tag naming conventions in the different file types.
In fact, there's little uniformity between tagging applications even within
the same file type, but there's not much that I can do about that.
<p/>
To make it possible to work on mixed file types with the same script, 
gettags provides 'common' names for the various tags, which map onto
different specific tags for different file types. For example, the
common tag 'album' will extract a tag call 'album', 'talb', or 'tal',
regardless of case. 'TAL' and 'TALB' are the names used within the 
various releases of the ID3v2 specification; 'Album', or 'ALBUM' are
usually used with Ogg and FLAC files.
<p/>
The common name <code>-c artist</code> will match (regardless of case)
'TP1', 'TPE1', 'artist', or 'performer'. The latter is necessary because
there is some disagreement about how to name the primary artist in 
FLAC tags.
<p/>
To get a list of supported common names, run:

<pre>
% gettags -c help
</pre>


<h3>Unicode issues</h3>

ID3v2 allows for a variety of different Unicode formats, even within the
same file. Ogg and FLAC use 8-bit characters, which in practice usually
means UTF-8.  
<p/>
To unify functionality across file types, 
all output from gettags is encoded as UTF-8, regardless of the original 
encoding. 
This is nearly always the best way to represent text data in modern 
computer systems -- UTF-8 is widely supported, and is automatically 
detected by the majority of applications that handle text. Most importantly
from a programming/scripting perspective, UTF-8 will never contain
embedded zero bytes, so UTF-8 strings can often be handled just like
ASCII.
<p/>
The fly in the ointment is Microsoft Windows file naming, which is complex
and poorly document. In general, passing a series of UTF-8 bytes to a  
Windows API function that creates a file will not give you a readable filename,
unless all the character values are in fact ASCII. This affects
MinGW as well, since it doesn't have the compatibility layer that
Cygwin has. Moreover, the Windows command prompt ('DOS box') is not
UTF-8 compatible -- the output from gettags will not be readable when the
file contains Unicode tags. 
<p/>
Under Cygwin, and using the Cygwin terminal, these problems are not
apparent. If I pipe the output of gettags into a perl script, and
that script uses the output of gettags to form a filename, then conversion
to Windows naming convention happens automatically. 
 

<h3>Limitations</h3>

1. gettags can't do anything about incorrectly formatted tags. For example,
if the encoder says that a tag is in UTF-8 format, but actually puts
UTF-16 into the tag, that's too bad. This happens surprisingly often.<br/>
2. It's possible for badly-formatted tags to crash gettags. If you 
come across one of these, please send it to me so I can improve the 
program.<br/>
3. gettags only handles text tags, and ID3v2 comments (which are a variety
of text tag). It won't extract pictures or anything clever like that.<br/>
4. If there are multiple tags with the same name, all will be extracted.
This could be a problem for scripts that are expecting a single line
response.<br/>
5. gettags does not support ID3v1 tags, because I don't think anybody still
uses them.
 


<h3>Example usage in a script</h3>

This example shows a simple perl script that renames a bunch of music files
according to the tags they contain. In practice, the process might be
more complicated than this, because a real script would have to deal with
issues such as illegal characters in filenames, or duplicate titles.

<pre style="background-color: #FFFFD0; padding: 5px">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

# A script that uses gettags to copy a bunch of music files to a new directory
# whose name is given by ${target_dir}/${album}/${title}/${extension}
# Where $target_dir is the first argument to the script, $title and
# $album are taken from the music file, and $extension is the original file
# extension
#
# Example:
#
# move_album.pl /media/my_albums /tmp/my_cd_rips/*.mp3

use strict;

die "Usage: move_album.pl {directory} {files...}" if (scalar(@ARGV) < 1);

my $target_dir = $ARGV[0];
print "target=", $target_dir, "\n";

system ("mkdir -p \"$target_dir\"");

for (my $i = 1; $i < scalar(@ARGV); $i++)
  {
  my $file = $ARGV[$i];
  my $album = `gettags -c album "$file"`;
  chomp ($album);
  if ($album)
    {
    my $title = `gettags -c title "$file"`;
    chomp ($title);
    if ($title)
      {
      my $ext = ($file =~ m/([^.]+)$/)[0];
      my $album_dir = "${target_dir}/${album}";
      my $target_file = "${album_dir}/${title}.${ext}";
      system ("mkdir -p \"${album_dir}\"");
      print "Copying file ", $file, "\n to ", $target_file, "\n";
      my $cmd = "cp \"$file\" \"$target_file\""; 
      system ($cmd);
      }
    }
  else
    {
    print "No album tag in '", $file, "\n";
    }
  }
</pre>

<h3>Bugs</h3>

If you find an MP3, FLAC, or Ogg file that gettags does not handle
correct, please let me know.
